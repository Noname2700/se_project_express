# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project focuses on creating a server for the WTWR application. Where users can have the full experience of the website and have a full functional run for them.
Throughout this project, we got to learned the basic and deep end functionality of the behind-the-scenes of a website. Mainly creating and running a server, handling errors, creating a database, as well as learning to connect it, all this was made possible for us by the multiple dependencies we added to our project to make the backend work, among them were the express.js, MongoDB, nodemon, which automatically refreshs our server and we dont have to exit and run again any time we mkae any chages to our project, and validator.
