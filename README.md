# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project focuses on creating a server for the WTWR application. Where users can have the full experience of the website and have a full functional run for them.
Throughout this project, we got to learned the basic and deep end functionality of the behind-the-scenes of a website. Mainly creating and running a server, handling errors, creating a database, as well as learning to connect it, all this was made possible for us by the multiple dependencies we added to our project to make the backend work, among them were the express.js, MongoDB, nodemon, which automatically refreshs our server and we dont have to exit and run again any time we mkae any chages to our project, and validator.

We then learn to secure our web app by implementing   JWT, which is a way for the server and the client to share sensitive information between eachother and was design to with following dependecies cors and brcypt which are a way for us to prevent the sensitive information from being stolen and use for long this really help us secure the page with sorten requirements that we added if the user is to a continue client, JWT will provide the verification and allow them to create a token that will permit users to use the web app without having to signin agian once the requirement are met JWT then take that info and store them in a safe place after that users can freely rom through the site.

## Running the Project
